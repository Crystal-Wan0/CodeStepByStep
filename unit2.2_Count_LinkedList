//Write a method count that accepts an element value as a parameter and returns the number of occurrences of that value in the list. 
//For example, suppose a variable named list stores the following sequence of elements:
//[one, two, three, two, four, two, five, two, two, six]
//A call of list.count("two") should return 5 because there are five occurrences of that value in the list. 
//If the list does not contain the value at all, return 0.
//The example shown is a list of strings, but this is a generic linked list class that can store any type of objects. 
//Assume that you are adding this method to the LinkedList<E> class as defined below:
//public class LinkedList<E> {
//    private ListNode front;   // null for an empty list
//    ...
//}

public int count(E value) {
	ListNode cur = front;
    int count = 0;
    if (cur == null) return 0;
    while (cur != null) {
        if (cur.data.equals(value))
            count++;
        cur = cur.next;
    }
    return count;
}
